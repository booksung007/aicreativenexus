AI image generation have been more center of the spotlight since AI have been widely talked about. Like text generation there is many different ways to generate AI image. Like text generation there is online option and local option. Payed and free(some what) options. Finally different AI models can generate excel in different types of images they can generate. Lets go over them one by one. 

First lets look at online and local options. As always there is different reason anyone would chose one from the other. Online AI model have different restrictions to what kind of image you can generate. On the other hand it is more Local models you have some powerful hardward to run this 

Paid and free service is obvious. Some online model is paid with differnt perks others are free. But you have to think about what "free" truelly mean to you because free means you still need to have a powerful hardware to run the AI model. 

Finally different AI model is fine tuned to be able to draw differnt style. Some model can be fine tuned diffrently. Other are fixed there is differance. 

Ok now that you know the different things to look for in chossing an AI  lets look at different individual AI service and model. If I have something more to talk about indiviual model I will have links to more indepth post about it. 
These are the AI service and model I have tried.

AI image generation have been the center of the AI generated content, grabing the spotlight and showing the world how AI have improved. I explored different ways to AI images. There are different ways to generate AI image like text generation there things to consider such as online/local, paid/free(somewhat) and different types of model tend to focuse on different type of art style. It's the same deal with text generation AI but I will go over the points once more.

First online and local models. Online models like text generation run on the server side, meaning they don't require beefy hardware. Also online service can generate images on mobile devices. I counldn't find anyway to generate image locally with mobile device. Finally it is really easy to set up, just hop on to a chatbot, website, discord and start generating. 

However, there is downside. There are lot more restriction to what kind of image you can generate when using online models. I find there are more limitation to what kind of image you can generate much more than text generation. I found jailbreaking is near imposiable.   

Online AI service to generate image.

Local model has no censorship allowing you full control of what kind of image you can generate. Privacy is guaranteed with local model. Unlike online model you can fine tune what kind of image you want to generate. Helping you to be more specific of what kind of image you generate. 

However, running a local models require more hardware investment, including CPU, RAM and most importantly graphic card(VRAM). A point to note is that running image generation locally require better hardware than text generation generally. Also some models can be incompadable with graphic card other than Nvida. There is lots of different things to learn if you want to run locally especially if you want a very specific image.

I am not sure if Hybrid option is available. 

Another aspect to consider is whether to opt for a paid or free option. While this may seem straightforward—either you pay for the service or you don't—it's not entirely black and white. There are free options available, but technically, 'free' is arbitrary since you still need robust hardware to run the AI. So, you had to consider this aspect as well.

Lastly, there's the question of how the AI works. Different AI models excels different tasks, this is more important in image generation. You still can put in prompt to make the model to generate different style like realistic, oilpainting, anime, cartoon and the model would generate the image according to the prompte but it could be optimized with different models. It becomes more differance when you want a more motion or movement in your image. So choosing is a bit more important.

AI image generation has garnered considerable attention recently, showcasing the advancements in AI technology. In my exploration of AI image generation, I've considered various factors such as online and local options, the choice between paid and free services (with some caveats), and the diverse capabilities of different AI models, which cater to distinct artistic styles. While similar considerations apply to text generation AI, let's delve into these points again with a more practical lens.

Online models operate on the server side, offering accessibility without the need for high-end hardware, and they're even compatible with mobile devices. Setting up online services is straightforward—simply access a chatbot or website to commence image generation. However, online models come with certain limitations compared to text generation, and circumventing these restrictions can be challenging.

Conversely, local models provide greater creative freedom and control over image generation, ensuring privacy in the process. However, they require more substantial hardware investments, particularly in terms of graphics processing power, and compatibility issues may arise with non-Nvidia graphics cards. Additionally, mastering the intricacies of local model setup may entail a learning curve.

I'm uncertain about the availability of a hybrid option

Considering whether to opt for a paid or free option isn't as straightforward as it seems. While free options exist, 'free' is somewhat arbitrary since robust hardware is still necessary to run the AI. Thus, this aspect must be weighed carefully.

Lastly, let's address how AI works. Different AI models excel in different tasks, which is particularly crucial in image generation. While you can input prompts to generate images in various styles, such as realistic, oil painting, anime, or cartoon, optimization may vary across models. This disparity becomes more pronounced when aiming for motion or movement in images, making the choice of model more critical.

In summary, when selecting an AI model, consider factors such as online/local options, paid/free alternatives, and the specific strengths of different models (bearing in mind there's no 'general all-purpose AI' yet).

**Online Image Generation AI Model:**

Pros:

- Accessibility: Operates on the server side, making it accessible without high-end hardware and compatible with mobile devices.
- Ease of setup: Setting up online services is straightforward—just access a chatbot or website to begin image generation.

Cons:

- Limitations: Online models come with certain limitations compared to text generation AI, and circumventing these restrictions can be challenging.

**Local Image Generation AI Model:**

Pros:

- Creative freedom: Provides greater creative freedom and control over image generation, ensuring privacy in the process.
- Control: Offers precise control over image generation, allowing for customization and specificity.

Cons:

- Hardware requirements: Requires more substantial hardware investments, particularly in terms of graphics processing power, and compatibility issues may arise with non-Nvidia graphics cards.
- Learning curve: Mastery of local model setup may entail a learning curve, requiring time and effort to understand the intricacies involved.
