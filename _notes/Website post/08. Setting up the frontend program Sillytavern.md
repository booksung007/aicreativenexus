Sillytavern is a frontend program focused heavily on the roleplaying aspect of AI. As a frontend program, you need a backend program or an online AI service to connect to in order to actually engage with the AI. In this post, I will go over how I installed Sillytavern on my computer.

[[07. Frontend what is it and what does it do]]

1. Download Node.js
2. Go to GitHub and go to the Sillytavern page
3. Click the green "Code" button and download the zip file
4. Unzip the file
5. Go inside the unzipped folder
6. Click on the start.bat file in the folder; this will start an instance for Sillytavern.
7. After the instance is complete, Sillytavern will open in your default browser.

That's it! That is how I installed Sillytavern on your computer. You still have to connect the frontend program, but I will go over it in the next post.
