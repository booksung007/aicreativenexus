So you want to write 

Other thing to consider is paid or free option. Well technically free is arbitary. There is some totally free option but you still have to have a good hardware to run the AI so can you trully call it a 'free' option?
Finally there is how the AI work. Different AI is good at different things. At least right now. Different AI is not general perpose not currently so you have to choose between different models. 

Now after text gen is sorted out what about image gen? Image gen is also follow the same workflow as text gen. We have to choose between online or local model, paid or free, and finally what exact model we will be using. 

Lets look at each options one by one. 

Here is some text generation model I have personally tired out.

There are many different text generatied AI currently available commercailly. The famous Chatgpt can be catagorized as text generation AI. 

There was few things I had to consider before chosing a AI model to let my mind go wild. There are online and local model. Online models are AI model that runs on the server side of the equation. This online services doesn't require a good hardware to run. This means it can run on moblie device. Also it is very easy to set up. Just have an internet connection and start generating right away. However the down side is you have to agree with the terms of service of the company that is providing the serivice. Which means there will be times when the AI will return 'can't comply' results. This can range from NSFW content to metion of violance and unlawful activity. Some deny of service is obvious but other times it seems quite abartrary.

On the other hand local model there is not much cencering so you can go wild. Also local model is local model every discussion and input is limited to the local computer this means total privacy. However local model require some heffty investment in hardware. This include cpu, ram and most importantly video card(VRAM). Also there are many time to read up on online guide to actually get the local AI up and running.

There is a hybrid option where you rent a server online. Hook it up to local model and run it like a local model. I have not really looked into this option.

Other thing to consider is paid or free option. This seem simple enough you pay for service or you don't but it's not all that light and dark. There are free  Well technically free is arbitary. There is some totally free option but you still have to have a good hardware to run the AI so can you trully call it a 'free' option? So I had to consider this. 

Paid/free option

Finally there is how the AI work. Different AI is good at different things. At least right now. Different AI is not general perpose not currently so you have to choose between different models. 
Different AI models have different use some model are just not suited for generating fictional content. Unless there is a real general all purpose AI model in the future I had to consider what kind of model I want to use in generating my text.

There are currently many different AI models available commercially for text generation. The famous ChatGPT can be categorized as a text generation AI.

Before choosing an AI model to let my creativity flow, there were a few things I had to consider. There are online and local models. Online models run on the server side, meaning they don't require robust hardware to operate. They can run on mobile devices and are easy to set up—all you need is an internet connection to start generating content. However, the downside is that you must agree to the terms of service of the company providing the service. This may lead to instances where the AI returns 'cannot comply' results, ranging from NSFW content to mentions of violence and unlawful activity. Some denials of service are obvious, while others seem quite arbitrary.

Let's begin with online AI models.

On the other hand, local models offer less censorship, allowing for more creative freedom. Since everything is confined to the local computer, privacy is guaranteed. However, local models require significant hardware investment, including CPU, RAM, and, most importantly, a video card (VRAM). Additionally, setting up a local AI involves reading through online guides and tutorials.

There's also a hybrid option where you rent a server online, connect it to a local model, and operate it as if it were a local model. I haven't delved deeply into this option.

Next, let's discuss the hybrid option in AI.

Another aspect to consider is whether to opt for a paid or free option. While this may seem straightforward—either you pay for the service or you don't—it's not entirely black and white. There are free options available, but technically, 'free' is arbitrary since you still need robust hardware to run the AI. So, I had to consider this aspect as well.

Lastly, there's the question of how the AI works. Different AI models excel at different tasks, at least for now. Not all AI models are general-purpose, so you must choose between them. Different AI models have different uses; some are unsuitable for generating fictional content. Unless there's a truly general-purpose AI model in the future, I had to carefully consider which model to use for generating my text.

**Online AI Model:**

Pros:

- Requires minimal hardware.
- Can run on mobile devices.
- Easy to set up, just need an internet connection.
- Powerful AI model 

Cons:

- Subject to terms of service of the provider, leading to potential censorship.
- Instances of denied service may occur, ranging from NSFW content to mentions of violence.
- Limited control over the AI's behavior and responses.
- Relies on an internet connection for operation.

**Local AI Model:**

Pros:

- Less censorship, allowing for more creative freedom.
- Offers privacy as everything is confined to the local computer.
- No dependency on an internet connection for operation.
- Greater control over the AI's behavior and responses.

Cons:

- Requires significant hardware investment, including CPU, RAM, and a powerful video card.
- Setting up a local AI involves reading through online guides and tutorials.
- May be more complex to configure compared to online models.
- Restricted to operation on a specific device.
