These guides will be a walk with me you will be reading the journal. I don't have a birds eye view of the whole AI field I am just a lone wanderer walking with you along the journey.

Also one more thing to keep in mind is the ever expanding and advancing field of AI. Things are constently changing so one service that is relavte this week maybe overshadowed the next by an overwhelmingly better product. Making the former obsoliete. 

Finally, model is king. What I mean by this is that even with the best UI or other buzz word like finetuning and such when a powerful LLM model close to AGI will be developed all of these things will be just nothing. Like some technologies making past technology obsolite one true AGI will result in every other project moot and obsolite. This will also make this site and guides obosolite because the ture AGI will be the only guide that will be needed in the future. 

But do not threat, this nihilisitic view might be very d

This nihilistic view might be dishearting. Making you think what is the point of all these guides. But all these point might be a blessing in disgise. Past technology going null and void means the field is inovating and evolving. We will be having a better AI that would be trully fit for our use. So I don't see this as a bad thing but a good thing. I hope new disruptive technology to appear and make a better future.
