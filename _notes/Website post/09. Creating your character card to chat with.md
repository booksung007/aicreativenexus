This is a writing to summerize my learning of how to create a character card. 

Mostly my information comes from the rentry document I found on 4chan.(Yes I sometimes browse 4chan and I am aware of the stigma that comes with it. But I learned a lot from that site and I want to give credit to were credit is dued.) I am not sure if this rentry author is someone posting in 4chan or this 4chan therad just happen to post this link to their general for use. This rentry doc is were I got most of my information in making character card. I combined different things I read from different rentry and use different parts of it when it is needed. On the following post I will rewrite what I chewed from these documents and explain how I understand the matter. This is mostly regergeration but with sprinkle of what I have experianced. If you wish to read the original source I will link the source at the end. 

I won't regergetate what is already well writen document. Instead I will write on how I use this docuement for myself.

There are four ways to write character card. Plain text, W++, JSON and Square Bracket. I mostly use Square Bracket format in most of my cards.
