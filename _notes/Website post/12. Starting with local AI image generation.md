Locally generating AI image is very similar with generating AI text generation locally. There is a model or checkpoint that will actually generate the image. These two phrase is used interchangeably. The backend program that will run the model or checkpoint. And frontend program that will provide with more options to give you more control over the generated image. 

With these three componant you can start generating somewhat passable image. But if you really want to make a very specific image that will satisfiy your inner vision you will have to be familiar with more concept such as but not limited to vae, sampler, LoRa, seed. All of this might be overwhelming but not to worry all great journy start with small steps and when you can start small and work your way to greatness.  

There are different ways to generate AI image locally but I have experianced with stable diffusion. So I will be explaining the local version of stable diffrusion. I will look at different models when I get the chance. 

The list goes (나무위키 그림 인공지능 관련 소프트웨서 참조)
1. Stable Diffusion
2. DALL-E
3. Midjourney
4. NovelAI Image generator
5. 

These are the three major models avaiable
